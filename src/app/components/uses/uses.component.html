        I love my MacBook, and with the M1 chips I keep toying with the idea of
        getting a new MacBook. But since I switched to
        <strong>Ubuntu with i3</strong> a few years ago, I can't imagine doing
        that anymore. As soon as there is a comparable window manager for MacOS
        like i3, I'll switch again ;)

          >window manager i3</a
        >. The biggest advantage for me: no UX. I have no menu to launch
        applications, or to switch between applications. It's all designed for
        me to use shortcuts as efficiently as possible to arrange windows,
        launch and close applications, and everything else you need. And the
        transition went extremely smoothly. If you haven't tried it yet, you
        should!

        I still use <strong>email</strong>, specifically Gmail. I've tried
        different email clients over and over but always fall back to the
        browser app. I use multiple inboxes to categorize emails, but basically
        I don't want any emails in my inbox at all. I'm a big fan of Inbox Zero.
        To minimize GMail to the bare minimum, I use the Chrome extension

        For <strong>notes</strong> and a <strong>knowledgebase</strong> I use
        respective private Github repositories, basically with Markdown files.
        For todos I use a Github project on one side and the standard iOS todo
        app on the other.
